# Timer script for [burp](https://github.com/grke/burp) backup in Go [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/computerfr33k/burp-timer-script.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/computerfr33k/burp-timer-script)

This is a port of the default [timer script](https://github.com/grke/burp/blob/master/configs/server/timer_script) written in go for cross platform portability without being dependent on system commands such as gnu date or bash, which is not installed on FreeBSD by default.
